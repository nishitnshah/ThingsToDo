Submitted by: Nishit Shah

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [X] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [X] Added a "+" button to toolbar to add new items.
